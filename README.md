# Traveller Trade

There are many applications that can help players automate the trade portion of their Traveller role-playing game sessions. Some work well while others are less intuitive, but in most cases, it is unclear which trade rules are actually being used. This website follows the trade procedure outlined in the Traveller Core Rulebook Update 2022. Dice rolls and the values used are listed in the browser's console for review.
